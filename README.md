# NOTE
This repository is forked from [kadiralan/NodeNurseBot](https://github.com/kadiralan/NodeNurseBot)

Also I have added some extra features to the original repository. This repository working differently from the original one. It is not sending a message every 5 minutes. It is sending a message when the node is down or catchup etc.. Also, it is sending a message when the node is not synced.

## üöÄ Introduction
This repository allows you to create your infrastructure to monitor the health of your mina node completely free of charge, without the need for expensive monitoring tools, with a few very simple steps.

## üõ† Installation & Configuration

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Telegram Bot
1. Open Telegram and search for the "BotFather" user 
2. Start a chat and send the command /newbot (Or click the /newbot)
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to name your bot and choose a username for it.
4. Once the bot is created, BotFather will provide you with a TOKEN which looks something like this: 110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw. Save this token for later.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating a Telegram Channel
1. In Telegram, click on the pencil icon (or the three dots) in the top right corner.
2. Choose 'New Channel'.
3. Name your channel and provide an optional description.
4. Set your channel to either public or private. Note: If you choose 'Public', you'll get a public link which others can use to join your channel.
5. Once the channel is created, click on the channel name at the top, then click on 'Administrators'.
6. Add your previously created bot to the channel as an administrator. Make sure to grant it the necessary permissions, especially 'Send Messages'.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Finding the Chat ID of the Channel
1. Send a message in the channel(its important to following steps).
2. Open a browser and visit the following URL (replace YOUR_TOKEN_HERE with the bot token you got from BotFather): https://api.telegram.org/botYOUR_TOKEN_HERE/getUpdates
It should looks like this; https://api.telegram.org/bot110201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw/getUpdates
4. Look for the "chat" object in the returned JSON. The id field inside this object is your channel's chat ID. It should look something like -1001234567890. Save this ID for later.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Setting Up the Cron Job
1. First of all define your TG_TOKEN and CHAT_ID in the below command.
2. And then run the below command.

```bash
TG_TOKEN="YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN"
CHAT_ID="YOUR_TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID"

cd ~ && \
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hakkisabah/minastatusbot/main/checkMinaBP.sh | \
